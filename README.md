# COMP10002-NamedEntityRecognition

In this assignment, I had implemented an NER algorithm based on a dictionary. For simplicity, the algorithm
only labels person names. Knowledge in linguistics is not needed to complete this assignment.

## Description
There are various NER algorithms. The core of those algorithms are linguistic rules (such as “last name
usually follows first name”) and statistics (such as how often “logan” is used as a movie name instead of
as a person name). Entity name dictionaries are often used to support those algorithms.

## Result

14.5/15 :thumbsup:

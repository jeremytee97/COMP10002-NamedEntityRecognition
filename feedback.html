<p>
<h4>Program Presentation</h4>

Including: layout and style, readability, adherence to coding
expectations, general care and appearance.

<i>Deductions</i>
<p>
Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker.
Marks in each section won't go below zero.
<p><ul>

<li>bad choices for variable names, -0.5; - e.g. it isn't clear what the difference between ch1 and ch2 is from their names
<li>inconsistent indentation, -0.5; - e.g. lines 269-274 - looks like you're mixing tabs and spaces
<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
END-CHOICES -->

<i>Additions (included in total mark only
if marks lost within this first section)</i>
<p><ul>

<li>comment that says "algorithms are fun", +0.5;

structures and declaration of them at the appropriate locations,
choice of parameters to functions, use of appropriate <tt>struct</tt>
and
<tt>typedef</tt> declarations, choice of algorithms or methods.
